 Tooth Segmentation and Abnormality Classification in Dental Panoramic Radiographs
---

### Introduction:
Dental panoramic radiograph (DPR) images play a vital role in diagnosing dental health conditions. 
However, interpreting DPRs for abnormalities classification and tooth segmentation is challenging and time-consuming. 
Our project aims to automate these processes using advanced image analysis techniques, machine learning, and deep learning.

Objective:
Automate tooth segmentation and abnormality classification in Dental panoramic X-ray Images to enable efficient and accurate diagnosis of dental conditions.

Methodology:
Image Processing and Advanced Image Analysis:
- Preprocess radiograph images to enhance quality.
- Implement advanced image analysis techniques for tooth segmentation.
- Extract relevant features from radiographs.

Machine Learning: Classification:
- Develop machine learning models for abnormality classification.
- Validate and optimize models using cross-validation.

Deep Learning: Segmentation and Classification:
- Develop deep learning models for tooth segmentation.
- Evaluate models using metrics like Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU).

 Dataset Description:
We use the Tufts Dental Database, consisting of 1000 panoramic dental radiography images with expert labeling of abnormalities and teeth segmentation masks.
